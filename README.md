# MPT

Manual Price Tracker is a personal project I created to help track the cost of frequently purchased items over time.

![Simple project example](./Example_01.PNG)

## Features
- Basic item purchase information (date, store, number of items)
- Price line chart per item
- Save files stored in xml format

## Dependencies
Dependencies are managed through the vcpkg.json file.  If you have vcpkg, you should be able to simply run ```vcpkg install``` to build the needed libraries.  See the [vcpkg repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) for more help.

## TODO
- Separate lines on line chart by brand/store
- Search for items in the list
- Hotkeys, mostly for saving
- Finalize in-progress changes so application matches version from example image
